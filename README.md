# Snoop - The Open Redirect Tester

## Description

A Python-based tool to test for open redirect vulnerabilities in web applications.  
It checks for both server-side and JavaScript-based redirects using common parameters and payloads.

## Troubleshooting

- **ChromeDriver Errors**: Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and matches your Chrome version.
- **Permission Issues**: Run with elevated permissions:
  ```sh
  chmod +x snoop.py
  python3 snoop.py
