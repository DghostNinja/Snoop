# Snoop - The Open Redirect Tester

## Description

A Python-based tool to test for open redirect vulnerabilities in web applications.  
It checks for both server-side and JavaScript-based redirects using common parameters and payloads.

## Features

- âœ… Detects open redirects using common redirect parameters (`redirect`, `url`, `next`, etc.).
- âœ… Uses various payloads to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- âœ… Supports session-aware testing (cookies).
- âœ… Detects JavaScript-based redirects using Selenium.
- âœ… Randomized user-agents and request delays for stealth.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome (for Selenium headless testing)
- Chrome WebDriver

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DghostNinja/Snoop.git
   cd Snoop
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have Google Chrome and ChromeDriver installed:
   - [Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
   - [Download ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
   - Or use `webdriver-manager`:
     ```sh
     pip3 install webdriver-manager
     ```

## Usage

Run the script and enter a target URL when prompted:

```sh
python3 snoop.py
```

## Example

```plaintext
Enter the target website URL: https://example.com
[>] Testing: https://example.com?redirect=http://evil.com
[!!] Possible Open Redirect! Status: 302, Location: http://evil.com
[*] Following redirect: http://evil.com
[+] Testing for JavaScript-based redirects...
[!!] JavaScript Redirect Detected: http://attacker.com
```

## Troubleshooting

- **ChromeDriver Errors**: Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and matches your Chrome version.
- **Permission Issues**: Run with elevated permissions:
  ```sh
  chmod +x snoop.py
  python3 snoop.py
  ```
- **WebDriver Issues**: If ChromeDriver is missing or outdated, install `webdriver-manager`:
  ```sh
  pip3 install webdriver-manager
  ```

## Disclaimer

This tool is for educational and security testing purposes only.  
Do **not** use it on systems without explicit permission.
